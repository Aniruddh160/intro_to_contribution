FEATURES OF OUR PROJECT

The software has the following three main components:-
1. Implement of new user to register and login. 2. Implement
user to choose any book.
3. Implement the user to buy books.
For the project, we propose to build an online book thrift store
for people. The online bookshop will contain novels, study
material and coursebooks.
Many students find books too expensive to buy at school
bookstores and many courses only use the required books only
for a few days in a semester. This becomes very wasteful and
frustrating for students and other people.
This online bookstore provides a solution to this. It will provide
a service in which students can buy books online without any
trouble. There will be free shipping. They need to register in
order to buy books. Payment information will be requested after
adding any number of books in the cart.
